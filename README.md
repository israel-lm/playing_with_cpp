# This project is just for fun!
I'm recapping some C++ concepts and putting all the stuff here.

## Build and run

The project uses the old and good cmake, so just make a folder named `build` or whatever, go into it, and run:

```
cmake <path to project root>

cmake --build .
```

Then you'll have several executables that you can run just like this:

```
./<executable name> [parameters]
```

That's it. Have fun!
